          <p>
           Ever since Aaron was young, he has been hooked on playing video games. This video game addiction one day let him wonder how video games are made. Thus, he took it upon himself to study the art and science behind game design and development. At first, he decided that he would prefer to become a stream and try making cash off of that but then he decided that he has the skills to code and was not applying them to anything. Eventually, he finally decided that he will learn how to design and code video games, but the most effort would be applied to code rather than the design since he wants to become a software engineer and not a game designer.

            <p>
              He was introduced to C# and ever since he has fallen in love with the language and game making. He has set his mind on working either for Nintendo or Unity - One of the biggest game industries globally. Additionally, he is striving for these goals to one day be able to buy a house for his family so they can live without worrying about rent. The gaming industry pays quite a lot so he hopes that he can get through with that. If he doesn't he still plans to make his games and become an indie-game developer whilst working as an original software engineer for other companies.
