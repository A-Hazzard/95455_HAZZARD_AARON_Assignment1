            As a young boy growing up in front of the television a lot. 
            Aaron has seen a lot of films that consist of persons hacking into 
            computer systems and this is what drew his attention to <em>code</em>. 
            As he saw these awesome films with hackers pulling up their laptops typing
             random green letters on the screen that made absolutely no sense to him. 
             He asked himself, 

            <br><br>
            
            “I wonder how all of this works, what do those text on the screen really do, is 
            this intelligence something that you naturally need to be born with?”
            
            <br><br>
            

            Ever since he had that thought, he decided that he would really love to learn how
             to hack computer systems, but first, he must have learned what is and 
             <a href="https://sphero.com/blogs/news/coding-concepts" target="_blank">THE BASICS OF CODING.</a> Later in his life he developed the logic for coding and realized that it is 
              nothing like the what the movies portray. He realized that coding, in reality, is a lot more 
              complicated than it looks in the movies and its not as easy as pulling up your laptop
               and cracking a code within a few seconds.

                  I've mentioned hacking, but what about software engineering? Coding/Hacking
                   compliments software engineering and with the skills he developed he was
                    already ready to become a software engineer. However, there weren't many
                     free learning sources for him to completely learn ethical hacking/Cyber Security so
                      he gave up on that dream and decided to stick with what he loves today -
