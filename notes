            As a young boy growing up in front of the television a lot. 
            Aaron has seen a lot of films that consist of persons hacking into 
            computer systems and this is what drew his attention to <em>code</em>. 
            As he saw these awesome films with hackers pulling up their laptops typing
             random green letters on the screen that made absolutely no sense to him. 
             He asked himself, 

            <br><br>
            
            “I wonder how all of this works, what do those text on the screen really do, is 
            this intelligence something that you naturally need to be born with?”
            
            <br><br>
            

            Ever since he had that thought, he decided that he would really love to learn how
             to hack computer systems, but first, he must have learned what is and 
             <a href="https://sphero.com/blogs/news/coding-concepts" target="_blank">THE BASICS OF CODING.</a> Later in his life he developed the logic for coding and realized that it is 
              nothing like the what the movies portray. He realized that coding, in reality, is a lot more 
              complicated than it looks in the movies and its not as easy as pulling up your laptop
               and cracking a code within a few seconds.

            As mentioned in the <a href="videography.html">“Why Videography?”</a> Aaron needs to be able to edit his videos. Seeing that he is in the tweens group they make a lot of content. This he needs to learn how to edit videos even for his TikTok and Instagram.

              Video Editing plays a key role when it comes to making content. However, unlike some persons that does video editing just for fun, Aaron doesn't, edit videos when he is bored - Only for content purposes

                 Ever since Aaron was young, he has been hooked on playing video games. This video game addiction one day let him wonder how video games are made. Thus, he took it upon himself to study the art and science behind game design and development. At first, he decided that he would prefer to become a stream and try making cash off of that but then he decided that he has the skills to code and was not applying them to anything. Eventually, he finally decided that he will learn how to design and code video games, but the most effort would be applied to code rather than the design since he wants to become a software engineer and not a game designer.

                    He was introduced to C# and ever since he has fallen in love with the language and game making. He has set his mind on working either for Nintendo or Unity - One of the biggest game industries globally. Additionally, he is striving for these goals to one day be able to buy a house for his family so they can live without worrying about rent. The gaming industry pays quite a lot so he hopes that he can get through with that. If he doesn't he still plans to make his games and become an indie-game developer whilst working as an original software engineer for other companies.
